Payment Gateway is a classic example of Strategy Design Pattern.
It has a context (Payment Gateway class) that enables selection of payment strategy at runtime.
Payment Method is the strategy interface that declares a common pay method or set of algorithm execution techniques.

Why this is GREAT design
✅ Strategy Pattern
Each payment type is a strategy.

✅ Open/Closed Principle
Add a new payment method without changing existing code.

✅ Loose Coupling
Gateway depends on interface, not implementation.

The system uses the Strategy pattern to encapsulate different payment behaviors,
and the Factory pattern to resolve the appropriate strategy at runtime based on the request
